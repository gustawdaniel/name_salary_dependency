Python 3.6*

Install packages

cd src

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

* in 3.7 there can be problems with sorting because of list sorts

# Get all values as an iterable with "values()". Once again we need to wrap it
# in list() to get it out of the iterable. Note - Same as above regarding key
# ordering.
list(filled_dict.values())  # => [3, 2, 1]  in Python <3.7
list(filled_dict.values())  # => [1, 2, 3] in Python 3.7+
